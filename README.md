  Instructions (can also be found within the game):
  
  - The goal of this game is to get the most marbles in your Mancala (or store)!

    - Each player has 6 pits with 4 marbles each (represented by #s). On each end of the board, the Mancala (or store) collects your total # of marbles needed to win.

    - The game moves counterclockwise! :dizzy:

    - When it is your turn, click one of your pits and the marbles inside will "empty" and distribute across the following pits, 1 marble per pit.

    - The game ends when either Player 1 or Player 2 has emptied all of their pits, and the person with the most marbles in their Mancala WINS! :clap:

    Player 1 is BLUE :blue_heart: & Player 2 is PURPLE :purple_heart:. 

  
  ## :thought_balloon: Next Steps: 
  - Add actual marble objects that move around the board, in place of the number values (#4 = 4 individual marbles in a pit)
  - Adjust functionality for when 1 marble lands in an empty pit and collects all marbles from the player's pit across from it, so that this only occurs when it is the last marble deposited at the end of a player's round.
  - Add game rule that when player's last marble is deposited into the Mancala (store), the player gets to go again
